# Install a hackintosh.
Why a hackintosh? Because I discovered Proxmox trying to get a hackintosh installed on the "new way", I got some other hackintosh working but on the "traditional way" with no virtualization involved. I followed the manual guide on Harvey’s Virtual Environment to get it running using "the new way" https://hsve.org/. 
Fortunately Harvey's team now has a automated way with pre-configured images and scripts that makes it very simple. Here is a video explaining:

BTW, you need a dedicated video card to get the video passthroug: https://hsve.org/passthrough/

Also, I need to get the main monitor plugged to the dedicated video card, and also a seccond monitor plugged to the internal microprocessor/motherboar output connector in order to work. Really don't know why, but works fine this way.
This seccond monnitor displays nothing, but if is not plugged in like that, it won´t work.

Check the Proxmox repository for further information
