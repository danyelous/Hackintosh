# Install a hackintosh.
Why a hackintosh? Because I discovered Proxmox trying to get a hackintosh installed on the "new way", I got some other hackintosh working but on the "traditional way" with no virtualization involved. I followed the manual guide on Harveyâ€™s Virtual Environment to get it running using "the new way" https://hsve.org/. 
Fortunately Harvey's team now has a automated way with pre-configured images and scripts that makes it very simple. Here is a video explaining:

BTW, you need a dedicated video card to get the video passthroug: https://hsve.org/passthrough/
